Component prerequisites
Prerequisite for the nfc-host-agent components:
The following libraries which are part of the Operating System distro are to be installed for the successful installation of nfc- host-agent rpm.
libhugetlbfs.so
libuuid.so - libuuid-devel is the library which has to be installed. For SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 12 service pack 4 and SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 12 service pack 5, it is a part of the Software Development Kit (SDK).
For the NFC agent to work properly, enable the following ports on the firewall:
RDMA/4420
tcp/3205
udp/3206
The nvme-clipackage is a part of this rpm and it may conflict with the preinstalled nvme-cli. Hence it is recommended to uninstall the default nvme-cli package before installing the rpm. Install the NVMe-Rdma drivers for NFC agents to work properly.
Known limitations
The following are a selected list of known issues and limitations related to the smart components and SUM version delivered with this SPP.

For a complete list, see the SPP Download page, select the Open CAs and Resolve CAs tab. This procedure can be followed to choose the preferred SPP version listed under the Generation specific menu, to open its related version page.

Integrated Lights-Out (iLO) Repository update for the components updateable by the Unified ExtensibleFirmware Interface (UEFI) do not install, if the Reboot Parameter in Smart Update Manager (SUM) is set to Never. See the Customer Advisory for more details.
While performing iLO 5 update on Linux OS, the user may see multiple Windows firmware components listed for installation. It is an expected behavior.
Drivers and enablement kits must be installed prior to the detecting and updating of some hardware and firmware. You may have to run SUM twice to ensure all the firmware components required for the installation are present.
There are several scenarios when SUM is run twice. SUM requires the drivers to discover the hardware and firmware needed for installation. After the drivers are installed for the first time and the system is rebooted, SUM must be run again to ensure that all the firmware components for the installation are present.
Network Adapters (NIC’s), Host Bus Adapters (HBA’s), and iLO require a driver or an enablement kit to be installed to be recognized by SUM.
The Linux firmware component for Emulex Fiber Channel Adapters and the Linux firmware component for the Marvell Fiber Channel Adapters require the target environment to have the libHBAAPI package installed from the OS installation media.
On the Emulex systems, install the Fibre Channel Enablement Kit for Emulex HBAs prior to the installation of the OneCommand Manager. If the OneCommand Manager is already installed on the system and the Enablement Kit is not installed, then uninstall the OneCommand Manager and install the Enablement Kit, and then install the OneCommand Manager again.
When running SUM on Windows, if the iLO Channel Interface Driver is not installed, then the iLO firmware will show a version of None as the installed version and Ready for Installation as the status on the Select Bundle or the Select Component page. It applies to the firmware for iLO 4 and iLO 5. When attempting to update the firmware, it may fail to update if it is already up to date. Downgrade of iLO from 2017.10.0 to 2017.06.1 is not supported and will fail to update.
When using SUM on Linux, the iLO Channel Interface Driver needs to be loaded from the operating system for the iLO firmware to display for installation.
BroadcomNICs are not discovered by SUM unless the appropriate driver is installed, and all Ethernet ports are up. The Ethernet port can be brought up by using the following command: #ifupethx or #ifconfig ethx up.
To update the firmware for Broadcom NIC, use the following steps:
Install the appropriate Windows or Linux drivers found in the SPP.
Enable all the Ethernet ports.
Run the Broadcom FW upgrade component.
Operating Systems support on the following HPE Converged Network Adapters is now frozen. There will be no Out-of- Box Drivers shipped or online Firmware flash components provided for these adapters for the following new Operating Systems starting from 2022.03.1 Service Pack for ProLiant. The only way to have the firmware updated in these Operating Systems is by launching the Service Pack for ProLiant in offline mode.
HPE Converged Network Adapters:
HPE CN1200E Dual Port Converged Network Adapter
HPE CN1200E-T Dual Port Converged Network Adapter
HPE FlexFabric 10Gb 2-port 556FLR-SFP+ Adapter
HPE FlexFabric 10Gb 2-port 556FLR-T Adapter
HPE FlexFabric 20Gb 2-port 650FLB Adapter
HPE FlexFabric 20Gb 2-port 650M Adapter
Operating Systems not limited to:
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 Update 4 or later
SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15 Service Pack 3 or later
Microsoft Windows Server 2022 or later
VMware ESXi 7.0 or later
UBM smart component firmware update is supported only in the case when the UBM devices are connected to SR100i controllers.
Due to some security issues, offline deployment through PXE server of Service Pack for ProLiant 2023.03.00.02 and later is not supported on Gen10/Gen10 Plus, Gen11, Gen12, and Gen12 SP Server platforms

2. Service Pack for HPE ProLiant Gen10/ Gen10 Plus SPP 2025.03.00.00 Release Notes
Description
The Service Pack for HPE ProLiant Gen10/Gen10 Plus (SPP) is a comprehensive system software and firmware update solution, which is delivered as a single ISO image. It uses the Smart Update Manager (SUM) as the deployment tool and is tested on all the HPE ProLiant Gen10 and Gen10 Plus servers as defined in the Server Support Guide.

Starting from SPP 2021.10.1 onwards, two SPP s are being released. One for the Gen9 products and the other for Gen10/Gen10 Plus products. Entitlement verification is not required for the Service Pack for HPE ProLiant Gen10/Gen10 Plus versions, but it is still required for the Gen9 (2021.10.0) and Gen9 / Service Pack for HPE ProLiant Gen10/Gen10 Plus versions (2021.05.0 and earlier).

PXE support
PXE (Preboot Execution Environment) boot is supported on HPE ProLiant Gen10, Gen10 Plus, and Gen11 servers with Secure Boot mode disabled.
NOTE
PXE boot is not supported in Secure Boot environments.
Using PXE boot in a non-secure mode introduces significant security risks. It is at the customer’s discretion to deploy components from the full SPP ISO over a network using PXE.
It is recommended to:
Isolate PXE traffic in a secure, segmented VLAN.
Using authenticated and signed boot images (UEFI Secure Boot alternatives).
Disable PXE after deployment is complete.
Limit PXE server availability and access.
Prerequisite for the nfc-host-agent components:
The following libraries which are part of the Operating System distro are to be installed for the successful installation of nfc- host-agent rpm.
libhugetlbfs.so
libuuid.so - libuuid-devel is the library which has to be installed. For SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 12 service pack 4 and SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 12 service pack 5, it is a part of the Software Development Kit (SDK).
For the NFC agent to work properly, enable the following ports on the firewall:
RDMA/4420
tcp/3205
udp/3206
The nvme-clipackage is a part of this rpm and it may conflict with the preinstalled nvme-cli. Hence it is recommended to uninstall the default nvme-cli package before installing the rpm. Install the NVMe-Rdma drivers for NFC agents to work properly.
