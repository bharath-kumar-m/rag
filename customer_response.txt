    libhugetlbfs.so
    libuuid.so (install libuuid-devel)
    Firewall ports to enable:
    RDMA/4420
    TCP/3205
    UDP/3206
    NVMe CLI conflict:
        Uninstall default nvme-cli before installing the SPP version.
        Install NVMe-RDMA drivers for NFC agents.

* Known Limitations & Update Tips
    SUM Reboot Parameter: If set to "Never", UEFI-based component updates via iLO may fail.
    Linux iLO Update: May show Windows componentsâ€”this is expected.
    Run SUM Twice: First run installs drivers; second run detects and updates firmware.
    Driver Requirements:
        NICs, HBAs, and iLO need drivers or enablement kits to be recognized by SUM.
        Emulex & Marvell FC Adapters:
        Require libHBAAPI from OS media.
    Emulex: Install Enablement Kit before OneCommand Manager.
        Windows SUM Behavior:
        Missing iLO Channel Interface Driver shows iLO firmware as "None".
        Firmware update may fail if already up to date.
    Linux SUM Behavior:
        iLO Channel Interface Driver must be loaded for firmware visibility.
    Broadcom NICs:
        Require drivers and active Ethernet ports (ifup ethx or ifconfig ethx up).
    Update steps:
        Install drivers from SPP.
        Enable Ethernet ports.
        Run Broadcom FW upgrade component.

* Adapter & Deployment Limitations
    Frozen OS Support for CNAs (from SPP 2022.03.1 onward):
    No new drivers or online firmware updates for:
    CN1200E, CN1200E-T
    FlexFabric 556FLR-SFP+/T
    FlexFabric 650FLB/M
    Must use offline SPP deployment for updates.
    Offline PXE Deployment Blocked:
    PXE-based offline deployment not supported on Gen10/Gen10 Plus, Gen11, Gen12 servers from SPP 2023.03.00.02 onward.
    UBM Firmware Update:
    Only supported when UBM devices are connected to SR100i controllers.
